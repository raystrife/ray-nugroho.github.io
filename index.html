				<h2>Video Games</h2>
				<p>Ever since I was little, I have always been invested in video games. I love to play as a character in the video game and experience his/her story from his/her perspective. It feels like I’m watching a movie, but I can interact with the world inside a video game. For this reason, I have always appreciated open-world games that give me freedom to explore their world.</p>
				<p>In the future, I’m interested to design my own video games. In preparation for this, I follow news about new game releases and reviews of recently released games. By reading these reviews, I can learn the characteristic of a great video game and mistakes that I can avoid. Currently, I’m taking an online course regarding video game programming in the Unity engine. Based on these commitments, I’m confident that I can design a video game that is both unique and appealing to the audience.</p>

				<p>Since late 2016, I have been heavily invested in a first-person shooter game called Overwatch. At first, I’m having difficulty to play Overwatch since this game has a high skill-ceiling and aim-intensive. To improve my aim, I spend some time daily to practice my aim in Overwatch. I use my free time to learn game strategies so that I can lead my team to win more matches. As the result, my current skill have improved greatly as I’m able to land more shots and predict what my opponents are doing.</p>
				<p>My best Overwatch heroes:</p>

				<h2>Food Gourmet</h2>
				<p>Food is where I find enjoyment in life. Ever since I moved to Waterloo, I have been cooking at home to reduce my spending. However, I must cook a better-quality food so that I won’t be tempted to eat outside. So, I look up the Internet for recipes that are tasty and easy to make. My favourite recipes mostly involve various spices and herbs such as chilli pepper, Szechuan peppercorn, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, and thyme. The resulting dish has a powerful flavour and a rich fragrance. Unfortunately, my friends always think that my dishes are too spicy.</p>
				<p> Some of my best creation: </p>

				<p>I love to try out various restaurants in hope of discovering stellar cuisines. Ever since I began my study in Waterloo, I have been trying out different restaurants in town. Surprisingly, Waterloo is a hidden gem for great Asian cuisines from China, Japan, and Korea. Whenever I visit a restaurant, I make sure to take a picture of my food and write a review about it in Google Maps. My hope is that my reviews will attract more customers to these hidden gems around Waterloo.</p>

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				<p>I have always dreamed to work as a full-time software developer. To achieve my goal, I have been enrolling in various computer science courses that are provided by the University of Waterloo. The most important subject that I learned from these courses is the object-oriented design by using C++. Since I’m interested in website development, I enrol in an online course that teaches front-end development by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, the co-op program of the University of Waterloo allows me to experience professional software development process from various software companies.</p>

						One of my first project is a chess game in C++ with several unique features. My game allows the user to save the current state of the game and load that specific save file. This is a great feature for the user to practice different scenarios or undo their mistakes. In addition, there is a “setup” feature that allows the user to place any chess pieces anywhere on the board before the game begin. In case a user is having difficulty to find a human opponent, the game comes with a built-in computer opponent with four-level of difficulty. Please check out this <a href="https://github.com/raystrife/Chess-Project" target="_blank">link </a> to find out more about my game.
